# Mechanics
##Basic Gameplay
This game is a turn based RPG, in which you choose attacks based on what you think will be super effective 

(For example, a fire creature would be weak to a water attack)
## Transformation
There is a transformation mechanic in place in the game. It is basically a trump card, as enemies do not attack you when you attack them in this form.
## Super effectiveness an critical hits
Depending on the attack that you use, you may do more damage depending on which enemy you are attacking

every attack has a chance to deal a critical hit, which does double damage, just like the super effective hit does
